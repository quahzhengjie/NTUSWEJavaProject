      <h2>About Us:</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of four skilled software engineers who have collaborated
        to create this application for our Back End Java Springboot Project!<br />
        Our journey began during a software engineering course in the Career
        Transition Programme offered by NTU (Nanyang Technological University).
      </p>
      <p>
        In developing this application, we utilized various technologies and
        tools to ensure its functionality and effectiveness.<br />
        We leveraged the power of Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, to
        create a robust and efficient backend.<br />
        The persistence layer is powered by PostgreSQL (PSQL), a reliable and
        scalable relational database management system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance the user experience and interactivity, we integrated the
        Thymeleaf template engine to render dynamic content and utilized Maven
        as our build automation tool.<br />
        For seamless communication between the frontend and backend, we employed
        AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to make asynchronous requests,
        allowing for a smoother user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the frontend, we focused on delivering a clean and intuitive user
        interface.<br />
        We leveraged vanilla JavaScript to handle the dynamic manipulation of
        the Document Object Model (DOM), ensuring that the application remains
        responsive and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our collective expertise and dedication have resulted in an application
        that aims to streamline the expense management process for us.<br />
        We are proud to have built a solution that combines the best practices
        of software engineering with the latest technologies, providing a
        reliable and efficient tool for our's needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for choosing our application, and we hope it serves you well
        in managing your expenses effectively and effortlessly.
